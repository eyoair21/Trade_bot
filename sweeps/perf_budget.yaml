# Performance budget configuration for regression detection
# Used by traderbot.cli.regress to guard against quality/speed decay

# Primary metric to track
metric: sharpe
mode: max

# Success rate: fraction of runs that must complete successfully
min_success_rate: 0.75

# Timing budget: P90 elapsed time must be under this threshold (seconds)
max_p90_elapsed_s: 60.0

# Metric regression: maximum allowable drop vs baseline
# If current best sharpe < baseline best sharpe - max_sharpe_drop, fail
max_sharpe_drop: 0.05

# Float tolerance for determinism checks
epsilon_abs: 1e-6

# Optional: timing percentile thresholds
# max_p50_elapsed_s: 30.0  # Uncomment to also enforce P50
